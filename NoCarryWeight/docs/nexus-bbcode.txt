[size=5]Installation[/size]

[size=4]Option 1: ASI Loader Version[/size]
1. If you don't already have an ASI loader installed, download one from [url=https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases]Ultimate ASI Loader releases[/url]
   - Choose the Win64 version of one of these files: [url=https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/download/x64-latest/dsound-x64.zip][b]dsound.dll[/b][/url], [url=https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/download/x64-latest/xinput1_3-x64.zip][b]xinput1_3.dll[/b][/url], [url=https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/download/x64-latest/winhttp-x64.zip][b]winhttp.dll[/b][/url], or [url=https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/download/x64-latest/winmm-x64.zip][b]winmm.dll[/b][/url]
   - Typically, [b][url=https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/download/x64-latest/xinput1_3-x64.zip][b]xinput1_3.dll[/b][/url][/b] or [url=https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/download/x64-latest/dsound-x64.zip][b]dsound.dll[/b][/url]﻿ would do for this game
   - Place your chosen ASI loader DLL in the appropriate game directory

2. Download the ASI version of this mod
3. Extract the ASI file to your game directory

[size=5]Installation Paths[/size]
[list]
[*] [b]Steam Version:[/b] [code]<Oblivion Remastered installation folder>/OblivionRemastered/Binaries/Win64/[/code]
[*] [b]GamePass Version:[/b] [code]<Oblivion Remastered installation folder>/OblivionRemastered/Binaries/WinGDK/[/code]
[/list]

4. Launch the game.

[b][u]Note:[/u][/b] If you don't see the [b]OBR-NoCarryWeight.log[/b] file created in the same directory after launching the game, the ASI loader isn't working. Try renaming your chosen DLL to one of the other variants until you find one that works with your game.

[size=4]Option 2: OBSE64 Plugin Version[/size]
1. Install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/282]OBSE64[/url] if you haven't already

[size=5]Comparison with Other Solutions[/size]
The [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/48]Carry Weight Modifier[/url] mod by E3roKK also resolves the carry weight issue, but uses a different approach:
[list]
[*] Their mod: Uses an ESP plugin that modifies game records (adds negative weight values to the lockpicks) and requires Plugin.txt updates
[*] This mod: Uses memory injection and hooks directly into the game's carry weight function
[/list]

Both methods achieve the same result. There is no significant benefit to using my mod over the ESP version, but I created it for my personal use and wanted to share an alternative implementation that doesn't require ESP management.

[size=5]Game Version Updates[/size]
This mod relies on memory patterns to find the right function to hook. When Oblivion Remastered receives updates, these patterns might change, requiring an update to the mod:
[list]
[*] For ASI users: Wait for an updated ASI file when game updates occur
[*] For OBSE64 users: Both OBSE64 and this mod may need updates after game patches
[/list]

Please be patient after game updates as finding new memory patterns takes time.

[size=5]Troubleshooting[/size]
If you encounter issues:
[list]
[*] Check the log file in your game directory (OBR-NoCarryWeight.log)
[*] After a game update, wait for a mod update as memory patterns may have changed
[*] Make sure you've installed to the correct directory
[*] For OBSE64 users: Ensure OBSE64 is properly installed and updated
[/list]

[size=5]Known Issues[/size]
[list]
[*] [color=red][b]IMPORTANT: If you previously used a negative weight solution mod (like Carry Weight Modifier), you may need to reset your inventory. First, try dropping all lockpicks. If that doesn't work, place your entire inventory into a chest, save, then retrieve all items to reset the weight calculation.[/b][/color]
[*] Mod developed and tested using the Steam version of Oblivion Remastered. Other platforms may not work
[*] May need updates after game patches (pattern-based approach)

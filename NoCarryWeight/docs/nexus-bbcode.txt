[size=5]Comparison with Other Solutions[/size]
The [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/48]Unlimited Carry Weight[/url] mod by bumbum2478 also resolves the carry weight issue, but uses a different approach:
[list]
[*] Their mod: Uses an ESP plugin that modifies game records and requires Plugin.txt updates
[*] This mod: Uses memory injection and hooks directly into the game's carry weight function
[/list]

Both methods achieve the same result. There is no significant benefit to using my mod over the ESP version, but I created it for my personal use and wanted to share an alternative implementation that doesn't require ESP management.

[size=5]Game Version Updates[/size]
This mod relies on memory patterns to find the right function to hook. When Oblivion Remastered receives updates, these patterns might change, requiring an update to the mod:
[list]
[*] For ASI users: Wait for an updated ASI file when game updates occur
[*] For OBSE64 users: Both OBSE64 and this mod may need updates after game patches
[/list]

Please be patient after game updates as finding new memory patterns takes time.

[size=5]Troubleshooting[/size]
If you encounter issues:
[list]
[*] Check the log file in your game directory (OBR-NoCarryWeight.log)
[*] After a game update, wait for a mod update as memory patterns may have changed
[*] Make sure you've installed to the correct directory
[*] For OBSE64 users: Ensure OBSE64 is properly installed and updated
[/list]

[size=5]Known Issues[/size]
[list]
[*] Currently only tested with the Steam version of the game
[*] May need updates after game patches (pattern-based approach)
[/list]
